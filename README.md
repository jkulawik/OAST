# OAST
Project for the subject OAST - A program which solves DAP and DDAP problems.

Would be a fork of https://github.com/pantalejmon/oast2 but we're rewriting it from scratch to better understand the subject at hand, provide better documentation and correct the naming of some elements to align with the subject's naming convention.
